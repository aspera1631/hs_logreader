# hs_logreader
Log file reader for Blizzard's Hearthstone

This project is for interpreting the log file written by Hearthstone. Right now it takes a saved log file, but I would like to have it read in real time eventually.

To configure Hearthstone to record a log, follow the steps here:

Note that this does not violate the ToS.
